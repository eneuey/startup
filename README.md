Elevator Pitch:
Have you every wanted to enjoy a strategy game with your friends? Games like tic tac toe are too simple, and games like chess have too steep of a learning curve, but gobblet is the perfect balance of both! My startup application will allow you and your friends to play gobblet any time any where!
Key Features:
ability to create an account and ability to play against others in real time from anywhere!
