Elevator Pitch:
Have you every wanted to enjoy a strategy game with your friends? Games like tic tac toe are too simple, and games like chess have too steep of a learning curve, but gobblet is the perfect balance of both! My startup application will allow you and your friends to play gobblet any time any where!
Key Features:
ability to create an account and ability to play against others in real time from anywhere!

SSH Command:
ssh -i NeuenKeyAws.pem ubuntu@3.132.185.117

Notes From Simon:
Through doing the simon deliverable I gained a much better understanding of how html works. I few of the elements I learned more about are the list, table, and icon element that shows up on the chrome tab. 
By adding css to simon I have learned how powerful bootstrap is. I will definitly use it a lot in my own start up project.
Adding the JS to my simon project has given be a better understanding of how html and JS enteract. I am now more comfterable with DOM manipulation.
